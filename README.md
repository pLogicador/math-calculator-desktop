### Calculadora
### I developed an application that simulates a simple calculator! Created in a day and a half using the c++ language as a base along with the Qt Creator framework...

 follow the instructions below:
 
As you can see, in the 'calculator' folder are the code files and tools I used when developing the main window and the main example script in .cpp and the main header. The next folder is 'installer_calculator' and contains the executable file (currently out of date on 26/08/23) if you want to try it out. This repository will be updated soon.
